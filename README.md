# Generic-Simple-Calculator-using-Linked-Lists-AVR
Implementing a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations using linked lists.
1. The calculator is able to preform one line multi-calculations process
2. It's implementing through modifying linked list nodes by adding another member called operator to store the operator with the next element
3. After each press for the operators, the algorithm stores the data and operator inside a node until pressing '='
4. The Algorithm loops the nodes to conduct all multiplications and divisions then loops again to conduct additions and subtractions.
